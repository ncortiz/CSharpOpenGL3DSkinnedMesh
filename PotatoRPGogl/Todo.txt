Finish adding bone data to mesh
and calculating everything super simple just look at page:
https://github.com/Jas03x/GL_GameKit/blob/436a7921f0c342de681732f6dd850277626fc03a/src/ColladaLoader.cpp


https://github.com/hasinaxp/skeletal_animation-_assimp_opengl/blob/master/main.cpp


Obj, fbx, dae file importing   V
Per mesh textures


Skeletal animations

skybox
heightmap terrain

Directional lighting

Sounds
Keyboard and mouse input
UI text and images
Screenspace shaders (vignette, toonshading and blurs)
Pathfinding
Character controller (gravity/jumping, collisions and movement)
Raycasting / sphere&cube collisions
Texture atlases
Pbr point and etc lighting



USE IT REFERENCES SKELETAL ANIM. TECHNIQUE IN THINMATRIX VIDEO BUT USING ASSIMP
SO NO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL

Assimp skeletal anims + fix to gaps? by using diff draw func.? OR maybe just get better rigged model
